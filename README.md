# Vector field pathfinding with neuroevolution

In this program, little triangular vehicles are programmed to follow a vector field which you can see by pressing space.
Their goal is to reach the green dot while avoiding both the outer walls and the rectangles you can place by holding your mouse.
Each generation, the closest triangles to the goal have a higher chance a passing their genes to the next generation.
The vector field will slowly evolve until the vehicles are able to reach the end.

This project runs on JavaScript using the p5.js library.
